Developed for the ATLAS Experiment as a tool to allow users compare JSON files of data from the LHC. 
This data and tool is not for public or commercial use, and should only present to demonstrate my abilities in Javascript, CSS, and HTML.

To use this tool, select Choose File and select one of the two provided JSON data files. Repeat for the other Choose File button with the 
other JSON data file, then hit submit.
